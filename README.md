The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. Theory and pseudocode [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

The code was created for the subject _"Selected Topics on Optimization - Introduction to Combinatorial Optimization"_, the web page [here](http://yalma.fime.uanl.mx/~roger/work/index.html).
